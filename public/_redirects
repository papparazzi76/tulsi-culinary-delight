# public/_redirects

# This rule tells hosting services (like Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
# how to handle Single-Page Application (SPA) routing.
# It redirects all paths to the root index.html file,
# allowing React Router to take over and handle the routing on the client side.
# The "200" status code means it's a rewrite, not a permanent redirect.
